# SOEN 341

## About

This project is a web application built with a MERN stack for a peer assessment system. This system enables students and instructors to evaluate their peers based on four dimensions.

## Problem

In group projects, it is often challenging to measure individual contributions accurately. This can lead to imbalanced workloads, with some team members putting in more effort than others, while all students receive the same grade. Without a structured feedback mechanism, students may feel their efforts go unnoticed, and instructors struggle to identify team dynamics.

## Solution 

This system enables anonymous peer assessments, allowing students to rate each other on four dimensions:
* Cooperation
* Conceptual Contribution
* Practical Contribution
* Work Ethic

 Each student provides feedbck using a 7-point rating scale and optional comments for detailed feedback. After submission, the system aggregrates scores, providing both students and instructors with clear insights into individul and team performance. 
 

## Features 
* Anonymous Peer Evaluation: Encourages honest and constructive feedback.
* Four-Dimensional Rating: Focus on cooperation, conceptual, practical contributions, and work ethic.
* Automated Score Aggregation: Instructors receive a summary of each student's performance
* Instructor Dashboard: Manage teams, view assessment results, and export date as CSV files.

# Running the website

Follow the instructions to launch the website on [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

## server

In the server directory, run `npm start` to launch the server including the connection to the database.

## client

In the client directory, run `npm start` to launch the app in development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your browser.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
